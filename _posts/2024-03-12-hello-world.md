### ***Hello World***
This is my second attempt at creating a blog. The first one didn't display posts which was annoying however hopefully this worked. 
Today, worked on wosDB and been making steady progress. I used Scrum practices of developing test cases as I am developing the collection class for the key and value database.  
If this works I'll try to continue making posts figure crossed. 

Checking out!!, 
Matt
